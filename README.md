🪐 MoneyOrbit
Visualizing Money Through Orbits & Clouds
🚀 Project Overview

MoneyOrbit is a financial visualization website that presents personal finances in a clean and intuitive way using visual metaphors instead of traditional charts or tables.

MoneyOrbit uses orbits as a visual layout and clouds as indicators, helping users understand financial conditions at a glance.

🧠 Core Idea

The project is built around three simple elements:

Money → The value being tracked

Orbit → A visual container for organizing information

Clouds → Indicators of financial pressure

These elements together convert financial data into an easy-to-read visual system.

💰 Use of Money in the Project

Money is represented as a dynamic value within the system.

Money originates from the Income Core

It is associated with different everyday-life categories

Each category has a predefined limit

The focus is on money awareness, not calculations or predictions.

🪐 Use of Orbits in the Project

Orbits are used only as a visual element.

Orbits act as visual sections to place money categories

They do not represent priority, distance, or importance

They help maintain a clean, circular layout

Orbits exist purely to organize the interface visually.

☁️ Use of Clouds in the Project

Clouds represent financial pressure, not cloud computing.

They provide instant visual feedback based on limit usage.

Cloud States:
Condition	Cloud Type	Meaning
Limit not exceeded	☁️ Normal Cloud	Stable
Near limit	🌧️ Rain Cloud	Warning
Limit exceeded	⛈️ Thunder Cloud	Critical

Clouds allow users to understand financial status without reading numbers.
